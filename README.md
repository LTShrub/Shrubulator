# Shrubulator
Basic Graphical Calculator in Java.
Simple graphical calculator based off of https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-swing-simple-calculator/ by https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/andrew1234. 
Personal project to become more familiar with Java elements nad creating programs in general.
Reorganized and rewritten with expanded functionality, improved readability, and a more method oriented approach.

To run simply extract both the build.bat and Calculator.java to a folder and run the build script.
